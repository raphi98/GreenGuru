## About The Project

![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]

Our web app helps users take care of their plants and use resources like water and fertilizer better. This is important because we need to save resources and help the environment.

Our app gives users a special plan for each plant, so they know exactly how much water and fertilizer to use. This means nothing gets wasted. We also teach users about different plants, helping them choose and look after plants in a way thatâ€™s good for the environment.

The app is fun to use because you can earn points for taking care of your plants and see how your friends are doing with their plants. This makes everyone want to do better.
